# Project--WordCloud-using-NLTK

<table>

**In this project we will analyze top 10 poems of Rabindranath Tagore using nltk(library of NLP).** <br></br>
**We will find the Term Frequency and Document Frequency for these poems. Then we will plot WordCloud for the TF(Term Frequency) and DF(Document Frequency).** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets what does Term Frequency,Document Frequency,Inverse Document Frequency, WordCloud in NLP means First**...<br></br>


**What does NLP means**?<br></br>
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science‚Äîand more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI‚Äîconcerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.<br></br>


**What is Term Frequency**?<br></br>
Term frequency is the measurement of how frequently a term occurs within a document. The easiest calculation is simply counting the number of times a word appears. However, there are ways to modify that value based on the document length or the frequency of the most frequently used word in the document.<br></br>


**What is Document Frequency**?<br></br>

Document frequency is the number of documents containing a particular term.Document frequency has several uses. First, it can be used to eliminate unimportant words from analysis. For example, you can enforce that words that appeared in at least 80% of your documents, can be removed from further analysis. This doesn‚Äôt just remove common words such as the, is and are but also domain specific words that are too frequent.<br></br>


**What is Inverse Document Frequency**?<br></br>

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is a weight indicating how commonly a word is used. The more frequent its usage across documents, the lower its score. The lower the score, the less important the word becomes.<br></br>

**What is Word Cloud**?<br></br>
It is a visualization technique for text data wherein each word is picturized with its importance in the context or its frequency. A word cloud is a simple yet powerful visual representation object for text processing, which shows the most frequent word with bigger and bolder letters, and with different colors. The smaller the the size of the word the lesser it‚Äôs important.<br></br>
